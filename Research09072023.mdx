## Why did I decide to get research experience?

<p>Going into college, I knew that I wanted to do research. I’ve always had a strong interest in the field of biology, so joining a research lab was one of my top priorities during my freshman year. Besides just being interested in research, medical schools also like to see that their applicants have done some research in the past.</p>

<p>Although most people (particularly pre-health advisors) will tell you that research isn’t required, doing research will help you develop valuable <strong>problem-solving skills</strong> that can directly translate into your future career. I can <strong>guarantee</strong> you that the majority of premeds at your college are definitely involved in some sort of research lab.</p>

<p>But even with that being said, don’t do research just for the sake of doing it. Do research that genuinely interests you—something you can eventually talk about in medical school interviews. If you do end up doing research with a lab for a long enough period of time, you might even end up getting a publication out of it. Although not having research isn’t the end of the world, having good (emphasis on good) research will certainly help you stand out as a medical school applicant.</p>
