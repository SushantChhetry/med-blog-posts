## Why Finding Your Reason to Pursue a Career in Medical is Important!

<p>Every time someone asked me why I wanted to be a doctor, I would always tell them that I want to help people. 
But this one time, someone followed that question with “so why not a social worker then?”. At the time, I didn’t have an answer to this question. 
I mean they weren’t wrong. It’s not like doctors are the only people that get to help other people. 
There are plenty of professions where you can help other people without having to go through almost <strong>12 years </strong> worth of school.</p>

<p>I’d say you can make an equal if not more amount of an impact by becoming a social worker, a nurse or even a teacher.
As time went by, and I got exposed to more and more experiences, not just through shadowing, but also by directly volunteering in a clinical setting, 
I can confidently say that I have a more nuanced answer to the very question that stumped me.</p>

<p>You see, growing up I've always been interested in the field of science, in particular studying the human body.
The way the human body works and how so much can go wrong with it has always interested me.
So, to get the opportunity to apply vast amounts of information to make a tangible difference in an individual’s life is what drives me to be a doctor.
Besides that, I also just like interacting with people. Getting the opportunity to build meaningful and lasting relationships with people who you directly serve,
which is a privilege a lot of professions don’t get, is also something that drives me to become a doctor.
Besides that, as a doctor you also get the autonomy and responsibility to make important decisions to achieve
the desired results without having to wait on someone else to tell you what to do.</p>
